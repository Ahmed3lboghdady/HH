# LED-Pattern-Controller
An Arduino program that controls six LEDs, lighting them up sequentially from left to right, and then reversing the sequence from right to left. Each LED is turned on and off with a brief delay to create a visible pattern. The program utilizes loops to manage the LED switching. A Fritzing simulation is used to visualize the circuit setup, showing the connections between the Arduino and the LEDs, making it easier to understand the wiring and components used in the project.
